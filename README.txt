Dental RPG:

In this dental RPG you will be greeted with a menu that allows you to start, view highscores and quit the game.

The outcome works in that it takes your name input greets you and tells you your dental enemies for the day.

Once the outcome begins you will have 4 moves to choose from each with their corresponding health affects plus or minus.
Once you select your move you will go into a trivia function in which you a dealt a random question and have to answer correctly.

The hearts taken off your enemy are determined by whether you answered quick enough and got it correct. 
You can win the program by beating all 3 enemies.

NOTE:
If you want to remove the sleep/countdowns search up "countdown()" in the py file and remove it from the main and the attacking_user functions.
